For folks building on the Raspberry Pi, you may need to remove the "-m32".
You can do this by inserting a "#" character before the -m32 option.  The
changed line should read:
ARCH 	:= #-m32

Note that this only applies to people running a 32 bit version of Linux on
their Pi.  If you're using a more modern 64 bit version, you'll need to
continue to include the -m32 flag - at least until the 64 bit build is
100% functional.
