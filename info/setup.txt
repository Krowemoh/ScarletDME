This file covers some setup & configuration topics you'll need in order
to build and run ScarletDME on your system.

Users & Groups
--------------
ScarletDME is set up to be "owned" by the qmsys user under the group 
qmusers.  Users of ScarletDME must belong to the qmusers group.

Add the qmsys user:
sudo useradd qmsys

Add the qmusers group:
sudo groupadd qmusers

Assign the qmusers group to qmsys, root, and any others that may need it:
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers root
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers qmsys
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers <userid>

Note that once you've added yourself to the qmusers group, you'll need to log 
out in order for the group addition to "take".  You also have the option of
entering "su <userid>", which will create a new shell that is aware of the new
 group you've been added to.
