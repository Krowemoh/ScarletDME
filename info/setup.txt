This file covers some setup & configuration topics you'll need in order
to build and run ScarletDME on your system.

Users & Groups
--------------
ScarletDME is set up to be "owned" by the qmsys user under the group 
qmusers.  Users of ScarletDME must belong to the qmusers group.

Add the qmsys user:
sudo useradd qmsys

Add the qmusers group:
sudo groupadd qmusers

Assign the qmusers group to qmsys, root, and any others that may need it:
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers root
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers qmsys
sudo usermod -a -G qmusers <userid>

Note that once you've added yourself to the qmusers group, you'll need to log 
out in order for the group addition to "take".  You also have the option of
entering "su <userid>", which will create a new shell that is aware of the new
group you've been added to.

If the system doesn't recognize you in the new qmusers group, you WILL see 
an error 3018 when starting a session that needs to create a new account:

Once you've got Scarlet built & you've done the "sudo make install" and 
"sudo make datafiles" steps, you can start the system like so:
    sudo qm -start
    
You can then start a normal user session by issuing the command "qm".
The makefile creates a symbolic link from /usr/qmsys/bin/qm to /usr/bin/qm,
so if you have /usr/bin in your path, you won't need to specify the full 
path to start or use the system.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
Make sure you're in the ScarletDME directory and then follow the instructions
below.

To build for a 32 bit system:
"make qm32"

To build for a 64 bit system:
"make"

"sudo make install" to install the binary files.
"sudo make datafiles" to install the data files.

After building and installing successfully, you can start ScarletDME by issuing
this command:
"sudo qm -start"

You can then cd to your home directory and start a normal user session like so:
"qm"

If you want to be able to compile the "internal" programs in GPL.BP, you'll need
to start ScarletDME in "internal" mode:
"qm -internal"

If you don't, you'll get compiler errors when attempting to compile any program that
has the "$internal" compiler option listed.
